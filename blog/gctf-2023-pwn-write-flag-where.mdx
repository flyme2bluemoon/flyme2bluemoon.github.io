In addition to the challenge prompt, the challenge binary was provided as an [attachment](https://storage.googleapis.com/gctf-2023-attachments-project/1c642ea2575b569441ed311ba1d614fb66ef4c571299b914e30ad2155b13e1075868ad442a04c2c256a4f3379702115820e69d1bce2368aaaef0b2fd30483b39.zip) and the remote IP and port were provided: `wfw1.2023.ctfcompetition.com 1337`.

## Connecting to the challenge

Using netcat, we can connect to the challenge server.

```sh
┌──(mshen㉿kali)-[~/gctf-2023/wfw1]
└─$ nc wfw1.2023.ctfcompetition.com 1337
```

In this challenge, we are also given `/proc/self/maps` which means that ASLR protections are bypassed and we know the memory address locations of the running process.

The challenge then prints the following message in a `while(true)` loop asking for an address and length:

```
Give me an address and a length just so:
<address> <length>
And I'll write it wherever you want it to go.
If an exit is all that you desire
Send me nothing and I will happily expire
```

## Solution

I used Ghidra to decompile and analyze the provided binary. As I read the code, I also annotated it by renaming the variables using names that made sense and helped me better understand the code.

![Ghidra decompilation of main](./gctf-wfw1-ghidra.png)

So from reading the decompiled code, we find that memory of the process is opened and we seek to the specified address and write the specified number of bytes of the flag into memory at that address. So how can we abuse this behaviour to leak the flag? In other words, at what location should we write the flag into the memory so that we can retrieve the flag?

An idea, we can overwrite the "Give me an address and a length" prompt with the flag string. All we need to do is find the address of that prompt so that we can write the flag into the location. We can either use a hex editor or the disassembled assembly code to determine the string prompt's memory location. Using GDB to disassemble the binary, we look for the part when the arguments for the call to `dprintf()` are being prepared which in a hex editor we can simply search for the string.

```
(gdb) disassemble main
Dump of assembler code for function main:
[...]
   0x0000000000001357 <+366>:	lea    rdx,[rip+0xe82]        # 0x21e0
   0x000000000000135e <+373>:	mov    rsi,rdx
   0x0000000000001361 <+376>:	mov    edi,eax
   0x0000000000001363 <+378>:	mov    eax,0x0
   0x0000000000001368 <+383>:	call   0x1090 <dprintf@plt>
[...]
```

Either way, we have determined that the offset for the prompt string is at `0x21e0`. Now all we need to do is add this offset to the binary base. Normally, this is where ASLR would kick in to prevent us from targeting specific memory locations but since in this case the memory maps are provided, the calculations are trivial.

```py
>>> hex(0x558fad12e000 + 0x21e0)
'0x558fad1301e0'
```

### Getting the Flag

With this, getting the flag is trivial. Simply send the calculated address and 127, the maximum allowable length, to leak the flag.
