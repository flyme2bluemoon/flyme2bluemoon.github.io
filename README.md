# My Static Page

[![Deploy](https://github.com/flyme2bluemoon/flyme2bluemoon.github.io/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/flyme2bluemoon/flyme2bluemoon.github.io/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)  
Once again, I have remade my static website this time using Gatsby since it seems to work better than Create React App.

## Check it out

You can find my landing page deployed here: https://flyme2bluemoon.github.io
Alternatively, it is also hosted on McGill School of Computer Science's servers: https://cs.mcgill.ca/~mshen/

## Status Page

Just for fun, I have also set up a [status page](https://stats.uptimerobot.com/E7JLyil9Jm) using Uptime Robot to see when Github Pages is down. LOL
